Ender IO 2.3.1.15 beta
-Update TooltipHandlerBurnTime.java
-After performance profiling I found 
-TileEntityFurnace.getItemBurnTime(item); 
-is computationaly expensive. It occupied almost a cpu core forever, because NEI starts a task thread every few seconds and this line of code keep iteraing through all the furnance recipe in GTNH. 
-Besides, usually the result of this computation is not useful.
-Add thread name check will help performance and will not influence the player.
-if (!Thread.currentThread().getName().startsWith("Client Thread")) return false;
-Update TileConduitBundle.java
-Greatly increase Client Side ItemConduit performance. (20% fps increase if have 100 - 200 item conduit in render area, these are lag-spikes.)
-EnderIO Conduits are very laggy, partly because Redstone/fluid/gas Conduits causing RenderChunks re-render back and forth. But if there is only one ItemConduit in the bundle, it is pretty sure that we only need to re-render ItemConduit near the player , because only player's behavior range (5) can change the shape of ItemConduit. 
-But if there is another conduit in the bundle, the re-render is not sure because Redstone conduit in the bundle might needs to re-render in any time. So in this case I left to default.
-Hide tile.blockLightNode.name in NEI
-Change fused quartz blast resistance 2000 -> 20
-Ignore dead entities
-Added forestry sapling support to farm station Cherry picked & backported from 1b242dc2d786b8c1fb545845768faa1f6c15818a

-I used this modified version for about 1 year and no problem happened.
-Update TickHandlerClient.java
-After performance profiling ,this reflection here occupies 3% of all the cpu time of Client Thread, resulting ~3% fps drop. So this change makes fps increase by ~3%.

-fix(Gradle)exclude planet files
-now planet files should be added to dev build
-Update NetworkRenderer.java
-After performance profiling, this change makes fps gain by 2%.

-isRecipeInputEqual optimization (#351)
-Optimize GT_Recipe.isRecipeInputEqual
-Used HEAVILY to catch duplicate recipes during game startup. Worst-case, it would result in 5 GT_OreDictUnificator.get calls for each pair of inputs.
-Instead, this is closer to 1 + 1/N, and as an added bonus, the modified unification it now uses doesn't copy its output only for it to be discarded immediately after comparison.
-Apart from inproved startup times, this might make a small difference when machines switch recipes.
-I am making an assumption that GT_OreDictUnificator.get(true, GT_OreDictUnificator.get(false, stack))
-is equivalent to a just GT_OreDictUnificator.get(false, stack), and the original code only double-unificated because it was easier to code. 
-If this turns out to be false, there's still some performance gain from factoring out the tStack unification, but some of the optimization here would be lost.

Not Enough Items 2.0.6-GTNH
-Update NEIClientConfig.java
-This reduce server start time for about 1 min. Very helpful to GTNH ssp player.
-Highly experimental support for backing to BQ when coming from there
-This is a highly exprimental solution to backing out of NEI's recipe view back to whatever opened it, such as BetterQuesting. 
-It seems highly likely that this will break something somewhere, but extremely quick testing did not find any such case.
-Too many ingredients, and apparently an empty fuel?

Open Blocks 1.6.3

-Could potentially be improved to only move the player away from the wall on one axis when possible.

ProjectRed-1.7.10-4.7.0pre13.9
-Update zh_CN.lang
-Change sendConnUpdate() -> onMaskChanged() in transportation module
-(This is a backport of the only functional change introduced in the transportation module by MrTJP's commit
-Fixed routing pipe bug that broke Overflow Chips
-More unified way of handling network pipe events
-Slightly tweaked how passive routing works
-Unified all routing pipes to conceptually work the same
-Eventually all functionality passed the network layer will be moved to services. All routers will be able to run services.
-There is planned abstraction to make the network work with any type of payload through any type of conduit. (I.E. One could create a liquid
-network, a wireless network, etc with extreme ease)
-Fixed item miscount for active requests
-Fix pipes sometimes dispatching an extra stack
-To recreate the bug: place two chests 10 blocks apart, connected by pipes.
-Place an extractor chip in the interface pipe that was placed first (the order
-is important), and a responder chip in the other interface pipe. Both chips
-should be configured to blacklist nothing.
-Fill all slots of the responder's chest. Have at least two stacks of stuff in
-the extractor's chest. Now, remove a stack from the responder's chest.
-If you did it right, you should see a stack being sent to the responder's chest
-to fill up the single empty slot... then, once it has arrived, a second stack
-gets sent, even though the chest is already full! This results in a stack of
-overflow in the pipe.
-The bug was caused by the PayloadArrivedEvent being sent too early. It was sent
-as soon as the item enters the final pipe, even though it hasn't entered the
-target chest at that point yet. Since the event removes the stack from the
-transitQueue, if the extractor pipe ticks shortly after, what it will see is
-that the target chest has an empty slot (since the item still hasn't entered it
-yet), but there isn't any item in the transit queue, so it thinks the stack
-wasn't sent yet. So it sends it again!
-Delaying the PayloadArrivedEvent until the item has actually entered the chest
-fixes this bug.
-The reason the bug didn't happen all the time was that it requires both of the
-following:
-1. Within one tick, the extractor pipe needs to tick before the responder pipe
-2. The extractor pipe's operation delay must reach 0 before the item enters the
-chest, but after the PayloadArrivedEvent has fired
-Only fire PayloadArrivedEvent if passing to inventory is successful
-passToInventory is called (and returns false) even when passing a stack into a
-pipe, so firing PayloadArrivedEvents at that point was a mistake.
-This fixes extra stacks being pushed into the network when a stack bounces back
-from a destination that's the wrong one for that stack.
-To recreate this, create a T-shaped pipe network with 1 extractor and 2
-responders, but no junction pipes.
-Add StorageDrawers compat
-Fixes request pipes only seeing up to one stack of items in drawers.
